\lettersection{About Me}
In 2013 after 6 years of web development, I started to learn Java to develop Android apps. Soon I was able to apply these skills in my job and switched to the mobile department of wetter.com. I was mainly fixing bugs before I was assigned to the Android project management to overview the redevelopment of the weather app. In the following two years I contributed my ideas, planned features and did user surveys and Quality Assurance to improve the app.\\
To be a programmer again, I changed my career path and started working as a full time Android developer in a Startup in Berlin. I maintained the previous app and because the structure did not meet the requirements of a contemporary app, I suggested rewriting the app. It was acknowledged which gave me the opportunity to upgrade the app architecture and getting rid of deprecated code.\\
In 2018 I was given responsibility for the mobile department. I managed and coordinated the development of tech demos inside the company as well as with freelancers.I began learning Kotlin on private projects to improve my Android skills. The most developed app is a schedule for the 35C3 (IT Congress in Leipzig). The official app has potential for performance improvements why I started working on an alternative. The app is not feature complete yet but the code is available in my repository in bitbucket.

\lettersection{Why Zalando?}
Zalando is the perfect place for me. Online shopping, especially for fashion, is an important part of people’s everyday life from all walks of life. A deep understanding of the importance of a fast and intuitive use of an app is needed. I put a strong emphasis on the connection between these core qualities and a pleasant experience for users. One thing that drives me is to share my ideas with my team and contribute my skills and knowledge to the success of the company. Zalando already has a great app which is enjoyed by millions of people. To maintain this status or even increase this is an exciting challenge which I enjoy taking up.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I'm a passionate developer with lots of experience in different fields and a high willingness to learn new skills and improve my existing skill set. I always keep the customers in mind while working on an app to create a balance between customer satisfaction and the company’s needs. With my long history of improvement and am aware that one will never know everything. I am very patient and eager to close my own knowledge gaps while sharing my own knowledge and offering my help.
